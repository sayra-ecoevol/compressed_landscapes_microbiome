monoculture_timeSeries.xlsx
---------------------------
-Time series of single species densities. 
-Eight replicates per species.
-Data for each species is given in a different sheet.
-Within a sheet, columns correspond to replicates and rows to sampling times (end of growth cycles).

pair_timeSeries.xlsx
---------------------------
-Time series of densities in competitions between species pairs.
-Each pair is competed in duplicate, from two different initial densities. Not all initial conditions/replicates are available for all pairs.
-Data for each pair is given in a different sheet.
-Within a sheet, rows correspond to sampling times (end of growth cycles), and columns to species. Different initial conditions/replicate are separated by blank rows.

trio_lastTransfer.xlsx
---------------------------
-Densities after five cycles of competitions between all combinations of three species.
-Each trio is competed in duplicate, from three different initial densities. Not all initial conditions/replicates are available for all trios.
-Data for each trio is given in a different sheet.
-Within a sheet, rows correspond to sampling times (end of growth cycles), and columns to species. Different initial conditions/replicate are separated by blank rows.

7and8Species_lastTransfer
---------------------------
-Densities after five cycles of competitions between all combinations of seven or eight species.
-Each competition is competed in duplicate, from as many initial densities as there are species.
-Data for each set of competing species is given in a different sheet. 
	- The sheet name indicated the species that was left out of the competition. 
	- The sheet named 'all_species' containes the outcomes of competing all eight species.
-Within a sheet, rows correspond to sampling times (end of growth cycles), and columns to species. Different initial conditions/replicate are separated by blank rows.
